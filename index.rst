Getting Started
===============

Download the latest SDKs for Python and Java.

Join the developer forum at
`/r/threatconnect <https://www.reddit.com/r/threatconnect>`__.

The ThreatConnect platform enables developers to query their data and
enrich it with powerful integrations.

The `RESTful public API for ThreatConnect <api_docs/#rest-api>`__ is
available to `developers with an API ID and Secret
Key <#getting-your-api-key>`__.

JavaScript apps may be installed by the user with the `Spaces
visualization
feature <http://kb.threatconnect.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2256255-creating-a-space>`__.

The official libraries to build a standalone App are available in Java,
JavaScript, and Python.

Python and Java Apps may be packaged and deployed on `ThreatConnect
Exchange <https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/exchange.xhtml>`__, which
is accessible to all ThreatConnect users.

(Contact support@threatconnect.com to have your application listed in
the Exchange)
