General Errors
--------------

Signature data did not match expected result
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error occurs when something is wrong with the signature used in the `Authorization Section <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/quick_start.html#authorization>`__. Make sure you are using the ``HMAC-SHA256`` algorithm and base-64 encoding to create the signature. Refer to the `Authorization Section <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/quick_start.html#authorization>`__ for steps to fix this error.

Timestamp out of acceptable time range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every API call to ThreatConnect requires a ``Timestamp`` header that is within five minutes of the ThreatConnect server's system time. If you get this error, you are passing in a Timestamp that does not line up with ThreatConnect system time. Refer to the `Timestamp Section <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/quick_start.html#timestamp>`__ for steps to fix this error.

Access Denied
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error occurs when one of the values in the `Authorization Header <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/quick_start.html#authorization>`__ is incorrect, or when you are making a request to an owner to which the API account you are using does not have access.

Creating Indicators
-------------------

There are a few details to keep in mind when creating certain Indicator types.

ASN Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When `creating an ASN Indicator <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/indicators/indicators.html#create-a-custom-indicator>`__ in ThreatConnect, the AS Number must be **prefixed with "ASN"** and should not include a space between the prefix ("ASN") and the AS Number. There are some examples of correct and incorrect indicator formats below.

.. code-block:: text

    ASN12345 # CORRECT

    12345 # INCORRECT
    AS12345 # INCORRECT
    AS 12345 # INCORRECT
    ASN 12345 # INCORRECT

Host Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When `creating a Host Indicator <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/indicators/indicators.html#create-host-indicators>`__ in ThreatConnect, the host must be in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). This means that Unicode Host Indicators (e.g. [internationalized domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name)), must be represented as [Punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode).

    xn--sterreich-z7a.icom.museum # CORRECT

    Ã¶sterreich.icom.museum # INCORRECT

Registry Key Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When `creating a Registry Key Indicator <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/indicators/indicators.html#create-a-custom-indicator>`__ in ThreatConnect, the **Key Name** for the Registry Key must start with one of the following values:

* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
* HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER_LOCAL_SETTINGS
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
* HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA
* HKEY_PERFORMANCE_NLSTEXT
* HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT
* HKEY_USERS

.. note:: If a Registry Key starts with ``HKLM\``, this must be changed to ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\`` before the Key can be created in ThreatConnect.

.. code-block:: text

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\001 # CORRECT

    HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\001 # INCORRECT

URL Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When `creating a URL Indicator <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/indicators/indicators.html#create-url-indicators>`__ in ThreatConnect, the domain name of the URL must be **lowercase**. There are some examples of correct and incorrect indicator formats below.

.. code-block:: text

    http://example.com # CORRECT

    http://EXAMPLE.com # INCORRECT
