Security Labels
===============

Security Labels provide a means to designate information stored within ThreatConnect as sensitive. When sharing data with partners, or when copying data to and from Communities, Security Labels provide control over what is shared and allow the sharer to redact information based on Security Labels that are applicable to Groups, Indicators, and Victims, as well as Attributes added to those object types.
