Notes
=====

Notes contain freeform information entered by a user and can be added to Artifacts, Cases, and Tasks. They enable security teams to journal key data findings in an unstructured format and can be used to provide commentary, directives to another user, additional details, or any information that cannot be captured elsewhere.
