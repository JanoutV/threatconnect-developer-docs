Notes
=====

A Note contains freeform information entered by a user (e.g., in a Case or attached to a Task or Artifact). Notes can be used to provide commentary, directives to another user, additional details, or any information that cannot be captured elsewhere. They enable security teams to journal key data findings in an unstructured format.
