Update Victims
--------------

The basic format for updating a Victim is:

.. code::

    PUT /v3/victims/{victimId}
    {
        {updatedField}: {updatedValue}
    }

Refer to the `Available Fields <#available-fields>`_ section for a list of available fields that can included in the body of a PUT request for the ``victims`` object.

.. note::
    When updating a Victim, you can use the ``mode`` field to add or remove the following metadata:

    - ``associatedGroups``
    - ``attributes``
    - ``securityLabels``
    - ``tags``

    See `Update an Object's Metadata <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/v3/update-metadata.html>`_ for instructions on using the ``mode`` field.

Example PUT Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following query will complete the following actions for a Victim with ID 2:

- Add a ``WebSite`` Victim Asset to the Victim
- Update the Victimâ€™s description
- Replace the ``TLP: AMBER`` Security Label applied to the Victim with a ``TLP: RED`` Security Label.

.. code::

    PUT /v3/victims/2
    {
        "assets": {"data": [{"website": "evilll.com", "type": "WebSite"}]},
        "description": "This individual was the victim of a company-wide phishing attack.",
        "securityLabels": {"data": [{"name": "TLP:RED"}], "mode": "replace"}
    }
