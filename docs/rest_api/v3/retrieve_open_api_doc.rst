Retrieve OpenAPI Documentation
------------------------------

You can retrieve an `OpenAPI document <https://swagger.io/specification/>`_ for ThreatConnect’s v3 API with the following query:

.. code::
    
    GET /v3/openApi

The contents of the OpenAPI document will be returned in JSON format, which can be uploaded to `Swagger™ Editor <https://editor.swagger.io/>`_ so that you can interact with the documentation.
