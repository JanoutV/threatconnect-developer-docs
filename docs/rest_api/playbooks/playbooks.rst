Playbooks
=========

The Playbooks feature allows ThreatConnectÂ® users to automate cyberdefense tasks via a drag-and-drop interface. The interface uses Triggers (e.g., a new IP address Indicator or a phishing email sent to an inbox) to pass data to Apps, which perform a variety of functions, including data enrichment, malware analysis, and blocking actions. Once enabled, Playbooks run in real time and provide users with detailed logs of each execution. Playbooks may also be saved for use as Components (i.e., modules) within other Playbooks.
