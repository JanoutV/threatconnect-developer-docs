Delete Tasks
------------

To delete a Task, the most basic format is:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/{taskId}
  
By way of example, the query below will delete the Task with ID 12345:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/12345

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
        "apiCalls": 1,
        "resultCount": 0,
        "status": "Success"
    }

Delete Task Metadata

Delete Task Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete an attribute from a Task, use the following format:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/{taskId}/attributes/{attributeId}

For example, if you wanted to delete the attribute with ID 54321 from the Task with ID 12345, you would use the following query:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/12345/attributes/54321

JSON Response:

    {
      "apiCalls": 1,

To delete a Security Label from an attribute, use the following format where ``{securityLabel}`` is replaced with the name of a Security Label that already exists in the owner:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/{taskId}/attributes/{attributeId}/securityLabels/{securityLabel}

For example, the query below will remove the ``TLP Amber`` Security Label from the attribute with ID 54321 on the Task:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/tasks/12345/attributes/54321/securityLabels/TLP%20Amber
