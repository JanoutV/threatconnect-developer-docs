Overview
--------
The ThreatConnect® TcEx App Framework provides commonly used Classes and Methods for writing ThreatConnect Exchange Apps.  The Framework is intended to speed up the development process and ensure that Apps contain the core functionality required.

This documentation provides a detailed view of the TcEx Framework as well as some App overviews.  The :ref:`building_apps_quickstart` section is a good place to start when working on the first App.  The section overviews are intended to provide details of the core functionality of an App, and the code references should provide further information for more in depth questions.
