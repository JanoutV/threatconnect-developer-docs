# Getting Started

Download the latest SDKs for <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/threatconnect/2.4.8">Python</a> and <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.threatconnect/java-sdk">Java</a>.

Join the developer forum at [/r/threatconnect](https://www.reddit.com/r/threatconnect).

The ThreatConnect platform enables developers to query their data and enrich it with powerful integrations. 

The [RESTful public API for ThreatConnect](api_docs/#rest-api) is available to [developers with an API ID and Secret Key](#getting-your-api-key). 

JavaScript apps may be installed by the user with the [Spaces visualization feature](http://kb.threatconnect.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2256255-creating-a-space).

The official libraries to build a standalone App are available in <a href="https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-java">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-javascript">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-python">Python</a>.

Python and Java Apps may be packaged and deployed on [ThreatConnect Exchange ](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/exchange.xhtml), which is accessible to all ThreatConnect users.

(Contact <support@threatconnect.com> to have your application listed in the Exchange)
