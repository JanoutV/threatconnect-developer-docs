SDK INTRODUCTION
================

This section explains the process of coding Python applications, and the
implementation of the Python SDK, using the ThreatConnect API. The
Python SDK offers coverage of all features in version 2.0 of the
ThreatConnect APIâ€”including the ability to write data to ThreatConnect.

The goal of this Python SDK library is to provide a programmatic
abstraction layer around the ThreatConnect API without losing functional
coverage over the available API resources. This abstraction layer
enables developers to focus on writing enterprise functionality without
worrying about low-level RESTful calls and authentication management.

This document is not a replacement for the official ThreatConnect API
documentation. This document serves as a companion to the official
documentation for the REST API. Read the official documentation to gain
a further understanding of the functional aspects of using the
ThreatConnect API.

How to Use This Document

This document explains how to create Groups, Indicators, Associations,
Tags, Security Labels, and Victims. Along with creating data elements, a
developer will learn how to create, update, delete, and request data
from the API using Python. This document assumes the reader knows the
Python programming language.

All code examples will be to the right in the code column in a separate
box with a monospaced font to facilitate explanation of code
functionality.
